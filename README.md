Hello, I’m Greg Rogers, im a student studying computer science at A-Level and hoping to continue my study at university within the next year. 
I’m interested in many aspects of computing such as machine learning but I have a particular affinity for topics focused on the combination of maths and computing.
- I’m currently learning C# and python as well as the OCR computer science A-Level syllabus.
- I’m looking to learn other languages like java as well as undertake many new projects such as creating a personal website.
